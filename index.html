        <div> What is the aim of price differentiation?</div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer-0"><strong>Answer:</strong> Price Differentiation is a strategy in which a business charges different prices for the same (or very similar) product based on the context (think bottle of beer supermarket vs untold). Context here refers to the spatial setting, convenience.   For similar products, differentiate on:- Quality (different raw material standards for different countries: e.g. algita ice cream uses better raw materials for Italy than for Poland, as Italians require a better quality)- Functions (e.g. better encryption standard for target clientele in military)- User-friendly (e.g. different user interface for different needs; e.g: for professional less is better, terminal accessibility is enough)</div>

        <div> Why is the pricing of SaaS software so fundamentally different from that of on-premise software?</div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer-9"><strong>Answer:</strong> Cloud providers invest a substantial amount into development and optimising their cloud infrastructure, so they can achieve low functioning and maintenance costs. They also benefit from the principle of “Economics of scale”. Because of this SaaS software uses a pay-as-you-go pricing and achieves good profit from it.

Cost type accounting: breakdown of costs by cause of consumption: property costs (e.g. rent or leasing machines), personnel costs, information costs (data collection, research etc.)2. Cost center accounting: breakdown of costs by organizational units / departments. Each organizational unit is assigned to a cost center. a. Cost centers can be: main (for departments that are directly tied to the production process), secondary (for departments that are involved In product preprocessing and post-processing e.g: delivery and logistics departments) and auxiliary (for departments that provide services to the entire company, e.g.: IT department)b. Cost centers can be: pre-cost centers (for common costs) and final cost centers (final allocation of costs)3. Cost object accounting: breakdown of costs by product / process. Types:a. Product cost accounting: accumulate costs related to a specific product (direct materials, labour and manufacturing overhead).i. Primary products: the main product of the companyii. Co-products: other products produced from producing the main product (on purpose and effort is made to sell this) (e.g. sawdust for processing wood)iii. Secondary products: generated incidentally from the production process, don’t really have value (e.g. waste)b. Process cost accounting: accumulate costs related to a specific process (in industries where there is a continuous repetitive process.

Base price is 100 -> you pay 70 per unit Triggered volume discount: discount applied to units in certain ranges with given discounts  Here average price per piece is 85 instead of 80, because 10% discount is applied to the first 100-199 for a price of 90 EUR and then 200-299 20% with a price of 80 EUR -> average is 85 EURFor the 30% discount we have: 30% for those over 300 so 70 EUR, 20 % for 200-299 and 10% for 100-199.

        <div class="answer" id="answer-82"><strong>Answer:</strong> calculation?On premise price calculation involves much more upfront costs that cannot be amortized over the use of product (software licenses and hardware). On the other hand, cloud price calculation allows for a metered payment model and amortization of investment costs over a longer period of time. Nevertheless, in the long run cloud services add up to more costs that on-premise.</div>

Subscription based: pay fee on term2. Device licensing: license per hardware, can be transferred3. Workstation licensing: per machine, cannot be transferred4. Floating Licensing / Concurrent licensing: shared licenses that can be used across the organisation and employees, regardless of location or deviceDynamic (pay-as-you-go):1. Pay-per-use licensing: like SaaS providers, chat-gpt etc. pay per volume or hardware utilization.2. Pay-per-overage licensing: like telecom providers, have a basic fee and consumption limit and pay extra for overage </div>

This serves as an indicator about the time/ duration/ quality on development of a new innovative technology. Conjoint Analysis is a survey in which individual characteristics of the product are broken down (e.g: screen size, price range, battery life, GB of RAM) and fed to the participants in order to assess which properties are the most important (generate the most variation) or how is the individual weight of each property to the value of the product.

        <div class="answer" id="answer-108"><strong>Answer:</strong> The Network effect is a phenomenon where the benefit the user gets from a product depends (logaritmicly) on the number of compatible products. More users using the product result in an increase for all other users and an increase in the motivation of non users to use the product. There is an increase in the benefit for the manufacturer of software as well. To be considered: Direct network effect: use of technology standard (3G, 5G, Bluetooth) or Facebook (or the new eu regulation USB-c charging ports) Indirect network effect: consumption of good is dependent on consumption of complementary good (e.g. playstation and games for it)</div>

Closing-rate-per-lead (leads that end in a closed deal / total leads)Problems with lead generation:- Wrong target audience- Wrong medium- Incorrect assessing of leads"Blue Bird": is a customer who requested an offer and then immediately accepted the offerExample:  A product house aims to achieve sales of €18 million during the fiscal year.The average order size is €50,000, so a total of 360 orders must be completed.The average hit rate for quotations is 70%, i.e. 515 quotations have to be created by the sales staff.On average, 5% of the leads are qualified enough for an offer to be drawn up. This means that 10,300 leads must be generated.The sales/marketing budget for this amounts to €570,000, i.e. this results in a cost-per-lead (CpL) of €55.34</div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer-130"><strong>Answer:</strong> Let N = #products, p = price per product, vc = variable cost per product, FC = fixed costs, then to achieve a break-even (no loss, no profit; profit = 0), then we have thatProfit = CM – FC = N(p-vc) – FC = 0 -> N = FC / (p-vc). That is the volume of product that needs to be sold to achieve break-even point.</div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer-131"><strong>Answer:</strong> A Receipt is an Earning when an increase in financial assets = increase in net worth (e.g sell a product in profit).

        <div> What is a profit and loss statement and how is it structured?</div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer-132"><strong>Answer:</strong> A profit and loss statement is a financial report that summarizes the revenues, costs and expenses during a period of time. It is different from a Balance Sheet, that only shows a snapshot of liabilities and assets at a certain time. It can be staggered-down or have two columns for debit and credit.        Debit is what is sold, credit is the revenue and earnings. The difference between sum(Credit) – sum(debit) is profit or equity. Profit is written down in debit but its actually first calculated by subtracting credit. If the balance is not equal there is either profit (equity) or loss.</div>

        <div> What is the difference between solution-oriented selling and provocative selling?</div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer-138"><strong>Answer:</strong> Solution-oriented selling: understand the customer’s needs and offer a solution to address those needs. Focused on dialogue, begin with a proof of technical feasibility, address known weaknesses, Feature -> Benefit -> Value. Spread of effort over a longer period of time.Provocative selling: challenge the customer current way of thinking, introduce a new perspective and a new need that is not, at the beginning, explicit for the customer. Challenge the status quo. Disruptive in nature, introduces thought-provoking ideas, more focused on risk taking, present new aspects to the customer regarding their situation. Effort is focused on the beginning of the negotiation time until the deal is closed. Thesis - Solution - Valuee.g: the customer wants a new database system, the seller convinces the customer that they should rethink their entire architecture from monolithic to microservices.</div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer-141"><strong>Answer:</strong> The cloud provider takes care up to a certain degree of the infrastructure needs of the company and offers certain software services that take care of the most important aspects of storing and retrieving data. The level of abstractization of these services depends on the type of service model: Infrastructure as a service offers only the infrastructure and VMs that can be used in any way the client desires, Platform as a service adds another level of abstractization, the clients works directly on predefined runtimes and Software as a Service offers direct high-level building blocks to the client that fullfill certain high-level tasks.</div>
